# TruckPark - mobile side
> The application has been designed and created as a complex solution for truck drivers and truck fleet companies to optimize the time of work and control trucks fleet. Both companies' management and truck divers could take huge benefits by using it due to economizing time and money. The system consists of two components. This Github repository concerns a mobile component.

## General info
> The main features of this mobile application are features helping truck drivers during his workday and send a truck's position to an application server. The driver has access to check his position, preview state of mops, and optimization module which is the most important feature in the app.

## Features
### User authentication
> User authentication is the first view after opening an application. This security view was implemented due to provide access to the application only for already-registered users. Logging view consists of two inputs: login and password. Currently, authentication data is mocked but eventually, the application will use the OAuth 2.0 protocol. After logging in, in the background working application the user's position and state are sent to the server application and saved in a database every 10 second.

### Main menu
> Main menu has been created as simple GUI consists of app logo and buttons: 
* Location
* Navigation
* Route schedule
* Where to pull off
* Find MOP
* Check weather
which let a user choose a specific functionality.

### Location service
> It is a basic feature, which let the user preview his/her current position (update interval- every 5 second). The position is visualized as a blue circle on a base topographical map provided by GoogleMap. User's interaction with this functionality is limited to zoom in, zoom out and move on the map. During driving time camera view is moved with changing position so the location point is always centered. During using the functionality, the user also has access to real-time data concerns free parking places for trucks on Mops.

### Navigation
> A feature that lets the user foud the most optimal route between any two locations. After typing values into inputs "origin" and "destination" and confirmation of a choice, a route between preferred points become shown on a map in the next view. The result is accomplished due to using of GoogleMaps RestApi service which the best polyline between two points has been calculated by distance, velocity, and traffic on roads. During using the functionality, the user also has access to real-time data concerns free parking places for trucks on Mops.

### Route schedule
> This functionality was developed to let a user inputs his/her route's origin, indirect points and destination. After pushing the "Save route schedule" button, the user can see communicate that schedule form was saved.During this operation location points are convert to modificated google map routes (using of GoogleMaps RestApi) and eventually stored in repository. Data which are inputed in this schedule form are used in application's main funcionality - Optiomalize driver's time.

### Optiomalize driver's time
> It the main and the most usable feature in this application. After inputting the route schedule in previous functionality a user has access to his routes visible on a map. At the bottom of the view, the user has information about travel parameters - origin, destination, remaining time and distance. Polygon of every fragment is clickable and after clicking the info form is displayed. A pop-up contains information about the fragment's origin, destination, duration, and distance. In the background, the main algorithm is launched every few minutes. Finding the closest MOPs algorithm is fully activated half an hour before booked break time (currently beak times are static - 4.5, 6 and 8 hours after workday start). Working of the algorithm could be divided into the following steps:
* Creating a polygon on the right side of the planned road (width- 15 meters). The main goal of this activity is the elimination of places that are on the wrong side to the direction of driving.
* Reducing MOP's set to items that are inside the polygon.
* Reducing the set to MOPs which are in a distance of 75 kilometers from current driver's position and sorting them from closest to furthest
* Found MOPs are converting to form and displayed as a pop-up. The pop-up contains some information about mops:
    * Name
    * Category
    * Number of places
    * Number of free places
    * Remaining time
    * Remaining distance

### Find MOP
> Find mop feature has been created as an access point to real-time MOP (Resting Place for Drivers) data. After MOP selection and confirm the choice, the user has access to current MOP's data. The data are updated in near real-time. On new views the user has access to some categories and information:
* Main mop data
	* Organization
	* Place
	* Identification data
	* Category
	* Coordinates	
* Road information
	* Road class
	* Road number
	* Direction
* Quantity of parking places
	* Quantity of truck places (all)
	* Quantity of free truck places
	* Quantity of passenger places 
	* Quantity of coach places 
* Facilities and safety (yes/no)
	* Security
	* Fence
	* Security video
	* Petroleum
	* Restaurant
	* Place to stay
	* Toilet
	* Carwash
	* Workshop
	* Lighting
	* ElectricCharger
	* DangerousCargo
* Information about MOP's owner
	* Organization
	* Phone number
	* E-mail adress
> The MOP data are collected from Rest Api Service established on server application (part of the system).

### Check weather
> Additional functionality allowed checking current weather conditions in the indicated location. Data are collected from external web services. Available weather information is: 
* Temperature(Â°C)
* Atmospheric phenomena
* Visibility (km)
* Pressure (HPa)
* Wind speed (m/s)
* Cloud cover (%)

## Inspiration
The project has been being created as a continuation of the author's master thesis - "Developing time optimization system for truck drivers" completed in 2018. Theoretical conceptions proposed in the document have been being implemented in this software. The main goal of this project is putting theory into practice.
